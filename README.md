# How-to-QA-in-Arma-3

This repository is fresh and WIP.

I am creating this collection and semi-structured guide as, to my knowledge, nothing comparible is available and everybody has to re-invent the wheel for QA purposes, which is a complete waste of time and leads to different QA standards. My aim is to point out the most important +-80% of asset QA within Arma 3.

This repository will contain guides on how to QA assets within Arma 3 for modders, testers and everybody else interested.
- Weapon QA (done)
- Vehicle QA (planned)
  - Land vehicles
  - Air vehicles
  - Water vehicles
- Gear QA (planned)
- Building QA (planned)
- Terrain QA (planned)

In addition there will be test missions which will be created with Vanilla assets so they can be universally used with every mod and without the need to get additional content first.
Currently there only is one test mission on Malden but hopefully also this will be expanded in the future.

If you would be willing to help me out, please open an issue and I'll reply there.

Thank you for your interest.
